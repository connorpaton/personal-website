# Strength Training Basics

Whether you're new to fitness or looking to refine your technique, understanding the fundamentals of strength training is crucial.

## Core Principles

1. **Progressive Overload**
   - Gradually increase weight, frequency, or reps
   - Allow adequate recovery time
   - Track your progress

2. **Proper Form**
   - Focus on technique before weight
   - Common exercises and their proper form
   - When to scale back

## Weekly Schedule

Here's a basic schedule to get you started:

- Monday: Upper Body Push
- Wednesday: Lower Body
- Friday: Upper Body Pull
- Weekend: Rest and Recovery

## Nutrition Basics

Remember that strength training is only part of the equation. Your nutrition needs to support your training goals:

- Protein: 1.6-2.2g per kg of body weight
- Carbs: Fuel for workouts
- Fats: Hormonal health

## Getting Started

Start with bodyweight exercises to build a foundation, then gradually add weight as your form improves.
