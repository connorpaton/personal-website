# On Waiting to Be Ready

> "It's a terrible thing, I think, in life to wait until you're ready."
> — Hugh Laurie

This quote has stuck with me since I first heard it. There's something deeply true about the idea that readiness is often an illusion—a convenient excuse we tell ourselves to avoid the discomfort of starting.

## The Trap of Preparation

We convince ourselves that we need:
- One more course
- A bit more experience
- The perfect moment
- More confidence

But the reality is that confidence comes from action, not the other way around. You don't feel ready and then start. You start, stumble, learn, and gradually become ready through the process itself.

## Why This Matters

The best opportunities rarely wait for us to feel prepared. The startup you've been thinking about, the book you want to write, the conversation you've been avoiding—none of these will become easier with more waiting.

Laurie's words remind us that the cost of waiting often exceeds the cost of starting before we feel ready.

## The Alternative

Instead of waiting for readiness, we can:
- Start before we're ready
- Learn by doing
- Embrace the discomfort of being a beginner
- Trust that competence follows commitment

The terrible thing isn't failing—it's never finding out what was possible because we were waiting for a feeling that might never come.
