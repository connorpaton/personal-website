# On Waiting to Be Ready

> "It's a terrible thing, I think, in life to wait until you're ready."
> - Hugh Laurie

This quote has stuck with me since I first heard it. There's something deeply true about the idea that readiness is often an illusion - a convenient excuse we tell ourselves to avoid the discomfort of starting.
